## Overview:

For this project I made use of the SWAPI Star Wars API to test my React muscle memory and to challenge myself with a few nested fetch calls. When a user first runs the program, they're greeted with the classic Star Wars movie scroll randomly selected from one of the Star War movies. From there the user can either select to look up people/characters, planets, or vehicles to display more information about them from the classic trilogy.
